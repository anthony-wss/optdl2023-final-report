Topic: A study on autodiff in PyTorch (group 1)

This final project compares the implementation of automatic differentiation in PyTorch and TensorFlow, the two dominant deep learning libraries. They differ in their approaches: PyTorch uses dynamic graph (eager execution), while TensorFlow 1.0 relies on static graph computation. These choices reflect their target users and design philosophies. We conducted experiments to analyze their performance and debugging capabilities. Our findings provide insights and recommendations for researchers, aiming to advance the field of automatic differentiation and guide future development.
